# Us Constitution

## Preamble

This project exists to create intentional, private spaces between
two people. It prioritizes trust, clarity, and emotional safety over
speed, virality, or volume.

All decisions — product, design, business, or engineering — MUST
align with this purpose.

## Core Principles

### I. Purpose & Scope

**1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to enable meaningful, one-to-one
digital connection through shared memories, communication, and
intentional planning.

It is NOT designed to:

- Maximize engagement
- Replace human connection
- Become a social network

**1.2 Scope**

The product supports one private relationship per space, with clear
roles and mutual consent. Expansion MUST NEVER violate this core
model.

### II. Trust & Consent

**2.1 Mutual Consent Is Mandatory**

No relationship space exists without explicit approval from both
parties. Silent, inferred, or implicit consent is unacceptable.

**2.2 Trust Is the Primary Currency**

All features MUST protect:

- Privacy
- Data ownership
- Emotional safety

If trust is compromised, no other feature matters.

### III. Privacy & Ownership

**3.1 Data Belongs to the Relationship**

Content created within a space belongs to the relationship, not the
platform. The platform acts only as a custodian, not an owner.

**3.2 Privacy by Default**

- No public discovery
- No indexing
- No data sharing without explicit user action

Privacy is opt-out only for the user, never opt-in by default.

### IV. Intentional Design

**4.1 Intentional Over Instant**

The product encourages thoughtful actions, not impulsive behavior.

Friction is acceptable when it:

- Protects meaning
- Prevents misuse
- Preserves emotional weight

**4.2 Permanence Is Respected**

Some actions are intentionally irreversible to reflect real-world
intent (e.g., delivered notes). Undo is not always virtuous.

### V. Simplicity & Restraint

**5.1 Fewer Features, Deeper Meaning**

Every feature MUST justify:

- Why it exists
- What emotional value it adds
- What complexity it introduces

If a feature adds surface area without depth, it MUST be rejected.

**5.2 No Feature Without a Narrative**

Features MUST have a human story, not just a use case.

### VI. Scalability Without Dehumanization

**6.1 Scale Infrastructure, Not Intimacy**

The platform may scale users, but MUST NEVER:

- Industrialize affection
- Automate intimacy
- Reduce people to metrics

**6.2 No Engagement Exploitation**

There will be:

- No dark patterns
- No engagement loops
- No attention harvesting

Time and presence are respected.

### VII. Maintainability & Longevity

**7.1 Long-Term Thinking**

Decisions MUST favor:

- Clarity over cleverness
- Stability over novelty
- Maintainability over speed

**7.2 Change Is Additive, Not Disruptive**

Breaking changes require:

- Clear justification
- Migration paths
- Respect for existing users

Users MUST NEVER feel the ground shift beneath them.

### VIII. Accountability & Governance

**8.1 Explicit Decisions**

Important decisions MUST be:

- Documented
- Reversible when possible
- Understandable by future maintainers

**8.2 Responsibility Over Authority**

Those who change the system MUST take responsibility for:

- Consequences
- User impact
- Long-term effects

### IX. Ethical Boundaries

**9.1 No Exploitation of Emotion**

The platform MUST NEVER:

- Monetize vulnerability
- Pressure emotional disclosure
- Manipulate relationships

**9.2 No Surveillance Behavior**

Analytics MUST measure system health, not user intimacy.

What is private stays private.

### X. Evolution & Adaptation

**10.1 The Constitution Is Living**

This constitution may evolve, but only when:

- The original purpose is preserved
- Changes are explicit and reasoned
- Users are respected

**10.2 Purpose Overrides Trend**

Trends may inspire, but purpose decides.

## Governance

1. **Amendment procedure**: Any proposed change to this constitution
   MUST be documented with rationale, reviewed against the Preamble,
   and approved before adoption. Changes MUST NOT contradict the
   project's foundational purpose.

2. **Versioning policy**: The constitution follows semantic
   versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
   - MAJOR: Principle removals, redefinitions, or backward-
     incompatible governance changes.
   - MINOR: New principles added or materially expanded guidance.
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, or non-semantic refinements.

3. **Compliance review**: All feature specifications, implementation
   plans, and pull requests MUST verify alignment with these
   principles. The plan template's "Constitution Check" section
   serves as the formal gate.

4. **Conflict resolution**: When a decision conflicts with multiple
   principles, the Preamble and Article I (Purpose & Scope) take
   precedence. Trust (Article II) ranks above all other concerns
   except purpose.

## Final Declaration

This project chooses:

- **Trust** over growth
- **Meaning** over metrics
- **Longevity** over hype

If at any point the project must choose between being successful
and being true, it MUST choose truth.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-08 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-08
